# Robot Gladiators

## Description
A simple JavaScript fighting game that utalizes the window prompt to ask what the user what they would like to do. The user will go through a series of fights with robots, choosing to either fight or skip. After each fight, the user can visit the store and choose to either refill a portion of their health or upgrade their attack damage. After three fights or if the user dies, the game will end and present their score. The application solely uses JavaScript to run the functions, but there is no styling.

## Installation
If you wish to play Robot Gladiators, you must first download the code. There is no backend so there does not need to be any installation of any packages. After accessing the code, you can simply open the index.html onto your browser and play!
